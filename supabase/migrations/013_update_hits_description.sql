  description = 'A story of betrayal, redemption, and the power of unity. Hits stands as proof that an alliance is not defined by the number of T10 players it possesses, but by the bonds that hold its members together.

THE BEGINNING

When State 244 was born, an alliance rose under the name Rusk. Starting from Rank 8, they were a formidable force—but nothing could have prepared them for what was to come.

THE LEGEND OF BABA YAGA

Whispers spread across the state of a player unlike any other. Baba Yaga. A force of nature who dominated the battlefield with terrifying efficiency. Under this legendary leadership, Rusk climbed from Rank 8 to claim the throne at Rank 1.

But legends often hide darker truths. Some say Baba Yaga was no ordinary player—whispers speak of corporate strategy, of goals met and missions completed. When the objectives were achieved, the legend departed, leaving behind an alliance that had tasted glory but now faced an uncertain future.

THE FALL

The departure left scars. Internal conflicts erupted. Loyalties were tested. Many players, disillusioned and lost, abandoned Rusk in search of new beginnings. The alliance that once stood at the pinnacle was fracturing from within.

THE RISING

But amidst the chaos, one leader refused to let the spirit of their community die. Rising—a name that would prove prophetic—saw beyond the conflicts. They saw the loyal warriors who had given everything, the players who believed in something greater than rankings and rewards.

With determination and vision, Rising claimed R5 leadership and began the impossible task of rebuilding. They restructured everything—from leadership hierarchy to battle strategies, from diplomatic relations to member welfare. And with this rebirth came a new identity.

Rusk became Hits.

THE FAMILY

Today, Hits is more than an alliance. It is a family—a diverse brotherhood spanning nationalities and time zones, united by mutual respect and a shared love for the game. Here, every member matters. Every voice is heard. Every victory is celebrated together.

Their strength lies not in overwhelming power, but in overwhelming unity. When Hits marches to war, they move as one. Their coordination has become legendary—often defeating alliances with superior numbers and more T10 commanders through sheer tactical brilliance and unwavering teamwork.

THE CHAMPION

Arc Of Death stands as the first and only T10 player of Hits—a commander whose skill on the battlefield is matched only by their humility off it. Respected by allies and feared by enemies, Arc Of Death embodies what it means to be a Hits member: powerful yet grounded, deadly yet honorable.

But Arc Of Death is not alone. Hits counts among its ranks many great players—commanders who may not yet wear the T10 badge but whose dedication and skill make them invaluable assets to the family.

THE LEGACY

Hits proves that the strongest alliances are not built on individual power, but on collective purpose. They show that family beats funding, that teamwork triumphs over talent, and that loyalty is the ultimate weapon in State of Survival.

From the ashes of Rusk, a phoenix rose. Its name is Hits.

And its story is just beginning.',
