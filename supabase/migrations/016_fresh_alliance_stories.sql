  description = 'What makes an alliance legendary?

Is it power? Wealth? Fear?

No. It is the fire that burns in the hearts of its members. The unbreakable bond that turns strangers into family. The absolute certainty that no matter what happens, you will never stand alone.

This is 300s.

THE FIRE WITHIN

We didn''t start at the top. We earned every inch of ground we stand on. Every victory. Every battle scar. Every sleepless night spent coordinating rallies across time zones.

When others gave up, we pushed harder. When defeat stared us in the face, we laughed and charged forward. When the odds were impossible, we made them possible.

That''s who we are. That''s what we do.

THE WARRIORS AMONG US

We are builders and destroyers. Strategists and berserkers. Early risers and night owls. We come from every corner of the globe, united by one simple truth:

Together, we are unstoppable.

Our members have achieved what many only dream of. T10 troops. The pinnacle of military power. Not one. Not two. A legion of commanders who have reached the summit and keep climbing.

But numbers don''t tell our story. Hearts do.

THE 300s PROMISE

When you join 300s, you make a commitment—not to us, but to yourself. A commitment to excellence. To growth. To becoming the player you always knew you could be.

We don''t carry passengers. We build legends.

We don''t make excuses. We make history.

We don''t follow trends. We set them.

THE PATH FORWARD

The throne at Rank 1 isn''t a destination. It''s a responsibility. A reminder that every day, we must prove we deserve it. Not through arrogance, but through action.

Every rally we lead. Every member we support. Every strategy we execute. It all builds toward one goal: maintaining the standard of excellence that defines 300s.

YOUR MOMENT IS NOW

You''ve played the game long enough to know the difference between an alliance that just exists and one that matters.

You''ve felt the frustration of being just another number. Of giving your all to a team that doesn''t see you.

That ends today.

300s sees you. We value you. We need warriors like you—players who bring passion, dedication, and the burning desire to be part of something greater than themselves.

The question isn''t whether you''re good enough for 300s.

The question is: are you ready to become the player you were born to be?

Join 300s. Ignite your legacy.',

-- Hits: Where every member matters
UPDATE alliances
SET 
  description = 'Have you ever felt invisible?

Like just another name on a roster. Another body filling a slot. Another resource to be used and forgotten.

We know that feeling. That''s exactly why Hits exists.

THE BROKEN PROMISE

Every alliance promises family. Unity. Support. How many actually deliver?

We watched players burn out. We saw talented commanders leave the game because no one cared. We witnessed alliances crumble because leaders forgot that behind every base is a real person with real feelings.

We decided to be different.

THE HITS DIFFERENCE

We don''t measure members by their power level.

We measure them by their heart.

Your base might be small. Your troops might still be growing. Your resources might be limited.

None of that matters.

What matters is this: will you show up? Will you fight beside us? Will you be there when a teammate needs backup?

If the answer is yes, then you''re already one of us.

THE FAMILY YOU''VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR

Hits isn''t just an alliance. It''s a home.

We have members who wake up at 3 AM to support rallies on the other side of the world. Members who spend hours helping newcomers learn the game. Members who celebrate every small victory like it''s a championship.

When you succeed, we all succeed. When you struggle, we all help. When you fall, we pick you up.

That''s not just talk. That''s who we are.

LEADERSHIP THAT LEADS

Our leaders don''t sit on thrones. They fight in the trenches.

They remember what it''s like to be new. To be confused. To need help. Because they were there once too.

Every decision we make, every strategy we plan, every rule we implement—it all comes back to one question: does this serve our members?

If the answer is no, we don''t do it.

THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM

They said an alliance built on heart couldn''t compete with alliances built on money.

They were wrong.

Rank 2. Not because we spent the most. Because we cared the most. Because when the battle got tough, we didn''t break. We held the line. Together.

We''ve defeated teams that outclassed us on paper. We''ve held our ground against overwhelming odds. We''ve proven that unity is the ultimate weapon.

YOUR INVITATION

This is your personal invitation.

Not to join an alliance. To join a family.

Not to become another number. To become a valued member.

Not to serve leaders. To stand beside friends.

You''ve been searching for something. Maybe you couldn''t put it into words. Maybe you thought it didn''t exist.

It does.

It''s called Hits.

Welcome home.',

-- Rage: Where warriors are born
UPDATE alliances
SET 
  description = 'Let us tell you a secret.

The strongest alliances aren''t built on power. They''re built on hunger.

The hunger to prove doubters wrong. The hunger to show the world what you''re made of. The hunger that wakes you up at night and whispers: you were meant for more.

Rage was born from that hunger.

THE BEGINNING

We had nothing. No reputation. No resources. No respect.

The big alliances didn''t even know we existed. And if they did, they didn''t care.

We were the underdogs. The forgotten ones. The team nobody thought about.

We turned that into our greatest strength.

THE RAGE PHILOSOPHY

While others rested on their laurels, we trained.

While others celebrated past victories, we planned future ones.

While others grew comfortable, we grew hungry.

We studied every battle. Analyzed every defeat. Learned from every mistake. We didn''t just play the game—we mastered it.

And when we finally stepped into the light, the world saw what we had become.

THE RISE

Rank 10. Rank 7. Rank 5. Rank 3.

Each step up the ladder sent a message: we are here. We are real. We are not going away.

We didn''t climb by outspending anyone. We climbed by outworking them. By outthinking them. By wanting it more than they did.

Now we stand among the elite. But we haven''t forgotten where we came from.

THE WARRIOR CODE

Rage isn''t for everyone.

We don''t want players looking for an easy ride. We don''t want mercenaries chasing the highest bidder. We don''t want tourists passing through.

We want warriors.

Players who fight until the last troop. Who rally when everything seems lost. Who refuse to accept defeat as an option.

We want players who understand that the greatest victories come from the hardest battles.

Is that you?

THE BROTHERHOOD OF RAGE

When you join Rage, you join something rare.

A brotherhood forged in battle. Tested by adversity. Strengthened by every challenge we''ve overcome together.

We fight for each other. We win for each other. We lose for each other—but we never stay down.

Our leaders have been in the trenches. They know what it''s like to struggle. They remember being the underdog. That''s why they fight so hard for every single member.

THE CHALLENGE

This isn''t a sales pitch. This is a challenge.

We challenge you to be more than you thought possible.

We challenge you to join a team that will push you, support you, and believe in you.

We challenge you to embrace the hunger that brought you here and let it fuel your rise.

Rage isn''t just an alliance. It''s a statement.

A statement that says: I will not be average. I will not settle. I will rage against the odds until I stand victorious.

Are you ready to make that statement?

Join Rage. Unleash your fury.',
