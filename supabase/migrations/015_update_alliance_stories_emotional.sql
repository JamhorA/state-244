-- 300s: The story of those who refused to lose
UPDATE alliances
SET 
  description = 'Some alliances are born great. Others earn it through blood, sweat, and an unyielding refusal to accept defeat.

300s is the latter.

FROM NOTHING TO LEGEND

They started as Jsa—Rank 6, overlooked, underestimated. The big players didn''t see them coming. They should have.

While others celebrated their early victories, Jsa was building something different. They trained in silence. They fought in shadows. They learned what it meant to lose, to struggle, to claw their way up when everyone said they couldn''t.

And then they showed the world what determination looks like.

Rank 6 became Rank 5. Rank 5 became Rank 3. And finally, against all odds, Jsa claimed what many believed was impossible—Rank 1.

THE REBIRTH

A new name for a new era. Jsa became 300s—a symbol of their journey, a reminder that greatness isn''t given. It''s taken.

THE T10 LEGACY

뽀록꾸 made history as the first 300s member to reach T10 troops—the highest level of military power in the game. That achievement during Season 1 wasn''t just personal glory. It was a statement. It was the moment 300s proved they could compete with anyone.

Today, 6 active T10 commanders lead the charge, with one taking a well-earned rest. Each one a testament to what dedication can achieve. Each one proof that 300s breeds excellence.

WHY 300s?

Because you''re tired of being average.

Because you want to be part of something that started from nothing and became everything.

Because you want to earn your victories, not buy them.

300s isn''t looking for players who want an easy ride. We''re looking for warriors who want to build something that lasts. Players who understand that the best victories are the ones you fight for.

We climbed from Rank 6 to Rank 1 once.

We''ll do it again if we have to.

Join us, and write your own legend.',

-- Hits: Where family means everything
UPDATE alliances
SET 
  description = 'In a world where players hop between alliances chasing power, Hits chose a different path.

We chose family.

THE RISE AND FALL

Once, we were Rusk. Rank 8, fighting our way up. Under legendary leadership, we reached the top. Rank 1. We had it all.

Then we lost it.

When the leader who brought us glory departed, cracks formed. Players left. The alliance that had stood at the pinnacle was falling apart. It felt like the end.

But endings can become beginnings.

ONE MAN''S VISION

Rising wasn''t going to watch his family die.

He saw the loyal members who stayed—not because of rank or rewards, but because they believed in each other. He saw the bonds that couldn''t be broken. He saw the heart of what Rusk really was.

So he rebuilt it.

New structure. New strategies. New name. Rusk became Hits—not a replacement, but an evolution. An alliance built not on one person''s power, but on the strength of every single member.

THE HITS FAMILY

We are players from every corner of the world. Different languages. Different time zones. Different backgrounds.

One family.

We celebrate each other''s victories like they''re our own. We rally when a member is under attack. We share strategies, resources, and laughs. When you join Hits, you''re not joining an alliance—you''re gaining hundreds of brothers and sisters who have your back.

THE HEART OF HITS

Arc Of Death achieved what many only dream of—T10 troops. The highest combat power possible. But ask anyone in Hits about Arc Of Death, and they won''t tell you about battle stats.

They''ll tell you about humility. About generosity. About a player who could brag but chooses to lift others up instead.

That''s who we are.

THE IMPOSSIBLE VICTORIES

Here''s our secret: we shouldn''t win as often as we do.

We face alliances with more T10s. More resources. More everything on paper.

But battles aren''t fought on paper.

They''re fought by players who trust each other completely. Who move as one unit. Who never give up, never break formation, never leave a teammate behind.

That''s why we win.

WHY HITS?

Because you''ve been in alliances where you felt like a number.

Because you want to matter.

Because you want to log in and see friends, not just names on a roster.

Because you believe that loyalty means something.

Hits isn''t the biggest alliance. We''re not the one with the most T10 players.

But we''re the one that will never leave you behind.

Join the family. Find your home.',

-- Rage: Where underdogs become legends
UPDATE alliances
SET 
  description = 'Nobody believed in us.

When we started as IronClad, we weren''t even in the conversation. Top alliances? That was someone else. We were background noise. Forgotten. Ignored.

We liked it that way.

While they fought for glory, we grew stronger in silence. While they celebrated their ranks, we sharpened our skills. While they looked down on us, we were already planning how to rise above them.

THE AWAKENING

Two leaders changed everything.

BeeocHH—the strategist. The mind that sees five moves ahead. The commander who turns chaos into coordinated destruction. When BeeocHH plans a rally, targets fall.

MightyAries—the warrior. The spirit that never breaks. The leader who fights beside you, not above you. When the battle turns against us, MightyAries is the one rallying the troops, turning defeat into victory.

Together, they forged IronClad into something new. Something dangerous.

They called it Rage.

THE RISE

We climbed. Slowly at first, then faster. Top 10. Top 7. Top 5.

Each rank we claimed was a message: we''re coming.

Now we stand at Rank 3. Not because we bought our position. Not because we had the most resources. Because we earned it. Every battle. Every rally. Every hard-fought victory.

THE RAGE DIFFERENCE

We''re not the alliance with the most T10 players.

We''re the alliance that doesn''t need them.

Rage wins through something money can''t buy: brotherhood. Discipline. The absolute refusal to quit when things get hard.

We''ve beaten alliances that outclassed us on paper. We''ve held ground against forces that should have crushed us. We''ve watched stronger alliances break while we stood tall.

Why? Because Rage doesn''t break.

THE BROTHERHOOD

When you join Rage, you join warriors.

Not mercenaries chasing the highest bidder. Not tourists passing through. Real warriors who fight for each other.

We train together. We grow together. We win together.

Our leaders don''t sit in ivory towers. They fight beside you. They share strategies. They celebrate your victories like their own.

That''s the Rage way.

WHY RAGE?

Because you''re tired of being underestimated.

Because you want to prove that heart beats resources.

Because you want leaders who lead from the front, not from above.

Because you believe that a united team of warriors will always defeat a collection of individuals.

We started as underdogs.

We became legends.

Your legend starts the moment you join.

Rage against the impossible. Win anyway.',
