THE RISE

When State 244 first opened its gates, an alliance emerged under the banner of Jsa. Starting from Rank 6, they faced fierce competition from established powers. But what they lacked in initial positioning, they made up for with strategic brilliance and coordinated teamwork.

Season after season, battle after battle, Jsa climbed the ranks. Their leadership forged bonds stronger than steel, and their members fought with the heart of warriors. Through calculated rally coordination, diplomatic finesse, and sheer determination, they ascended to the throne—Rank 1.

THE EVOLUTION

With their new position came a new identity. Jsa became 300s—a name that echoes across the state as a symbol of excellence and dominance. The rebranding marked not just a change in name, but a declaration: they were here to lead.

PIONEERS OF POWER

The alliance''s first T10 player (Tier 10 Troops—the highest troop level in the game), 뽀록꾸, achieved this legendary milestone during Season 1. This achievement set the standard for what it means to be a 300s member.

PRESENT DAY

Today, 300s stands as the pinnacle of State 244. The alliance boasts 7 T10 players (commanders with Tier 10 Troops), with 6 currently active on the battlefield while one takes a well-deserved respite. Their roster includes some of the most formidable commanders in the state, each one a master of their craft.

JOIN THE LEGACY

300s isn''t just an alliance—it''s a brotherhood forged in war, united by purpose, and driven by the pursuit of greatness. Those who wear the 300s tag carry the weight of a legacy built by warriors who refused to settle for anything less than the top.

The journey from Rank 6 to Rank 1 is complete. The reign of 300s has begun.',
